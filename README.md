# WHY
when i was trying artix i saw that i cant build artix own packages from source directly
and you know that a optimize packages can give us 15 to 20 % boost in performance so i decided 
to take matters in my own hand and this is the result 

# HOW
using python and a custom .makepkg.conf

# Necessary 
no 

## LITTLE BIT ABOU ME PLz
I am just student and thought it will be cool after trying cachy os
